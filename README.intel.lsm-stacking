Linux kernel security module stacking
============

This enables full stacking of Linux security modules.
It allows "major" security modules to be used at the same time.
The major security modules are:
	SELinux
	Smack
	TOMOYO
	AppArmor

This is platform agnostic.

This is not a bug fix. This removes a longstanding limitation
that the kernel can support only one major security module at
a time. There are no know bugs introduced by this code.
