	  Say yes here if you want to access RPMB from user space
	  via character device interface /dev/rpmbmux, which is acted
	  as a multiplexor for RPMB by calling RPMB native driver directly.

	  It owns RPMB authentication key internally for RPMB
	  virtualization usage.The users who don't own RPMB key
	  in such a RPMB virtualization use case could enable it.
